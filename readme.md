# Laravel Mix Without Laravel

In my tutorial called [Laravel Elixir Without Laravel](https://laravelista.com/lessons/laravel-elixir-without-laravel) we have gone over installing Laravel Elixir, configuring it to match our custom folder structure and adding tasks.

In this lesson we will do the same thing, but with Laravel Mix.  We will create a custom non-Laravel project, install Laravel Mix and make it handle our assets.

## Installation

To install all dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

## Usage

Run all tasks:

```
yarn dev
```

Run all tasks and minify:

```
yarn production
```

Run all tasks and watch for changes (first run this will install additional dependencies):

```
yarn watch
```
